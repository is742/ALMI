# the mission assigned to the agent (agent.mission.tasks).
#
# A breakdown of the mission is performed to analyse discrete section of the 
# mission which could be performed in any order, with permutations created for 
# every single possible configuration of the mission.

# The solution is solved using a least distance analysis whilst also validating 
# the probabiltiy of the solution using PRISM.
